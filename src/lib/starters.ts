/**
 * Starter trips for the first visit.
 *
 * The brief is explicit that a new person must get something useful immediately and
 * must not be dropped into an empty screen. So the first visit offers three ready-made
 * trips, and one tap builds a real one — real dates, a real packing list — which can be
 * edited afterwards. Nothing is asked for up front.
 *
 * Dates are relative to today so a starter is never stale.
