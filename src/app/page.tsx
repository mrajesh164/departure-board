/**
 * The front door, with two faces.
 *
 * Someone arriving for the first time gets the onboarding here: what the tool
 * is, in one breath, and three ready-made trips where one tap produces a real
 * packing list. No account, no tour, nothing to fill in first.
 *
 * Someone coming back gets the live state instead — the next departure and
 * what's still unpacked — so home isn't a toll gate between them and the list
 * they came to finish.
 *
 * Which face shows is decided twice: by the inline script in <head> through the
 * data-when CSS gate before first paint, and by React once storage has been
 * read. That's what stops a returning person seeing the first-visit screen
 * flicker past. See globals.css and lib/storage.ts.
